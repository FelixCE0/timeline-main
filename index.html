            <h1>The Final TimeLine</h1>
            <p>Throughout the school year i have
                learned how to edit and manipulate images,
                create graphics and visual assets for websites
                or multimedia projects,
                and enhance the overall visual appeal of your
                designs.I
                have learned HTML to structure web pages,
                CSS to style and layout the elements, and
                JavaScript to add interactivity
                and dynamic functionality to your websites.
                Dreamweaver used it to create and manage web pages,
                combining its visual design capabilities with manual
                coding to build
                responsive and visually appealing websites.Adobe Premiere Pro
                was really helpful learned how to import, edit, and enhance video
                footage, add transitions and effects, and export your
                final videos for various platforms and many more.

                        Premiere Pro follows a non-linear editing (NLE)
                        workflow, allowing you to work with video clips,
                        audio files, images, and other media assets in a
                        non-linear and flexible manner. This means you can
                        arrange and manipulate your content on a timeline
                        without having to follow a strict chronological order.
                        Premiere Pro provides a timeline interface where you
                        can organize and edit your video and audio tracks.
                        You can create multiple sequences within a project
                        to work on different
                        edits, variations, or versions of your video project.
